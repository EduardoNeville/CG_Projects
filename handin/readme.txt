TEXTURES:

Task GL3.1.1: Sampling a texture

Task GL3.1.2: UV coordinates and wrapping modes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Using the UV coordinates form the shader vertex we sampled the texture color and stored it in tex_color.
We then editted the UV coordinates to be able to use the wrapping on the tiling floor.

ENVIRONMENT MAPPING:

Task GL3.2.1: Projection matrix for a cube camera

Task GL3.2.2: Up vectors for cube camera

Task GL3.2.3: Reflection shader

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Created the cube faces of the camera produces by the projection matrix, editing the vectors gave us the CUBE_FACE_UP.  

We then used the CUBE_FACE_UP to create the reflection shader and so a mirroring effect.

REAL-TIME SHADOWS WITH SHADOW MAPPING:

Task GL3.3.1: Phong Lighting Shader with Shadows

Task GL3.3.2 Blend Options

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Shading was done with a new reviewed version of Phong Lighting and Shadows using a different approach in the specular term argument of the intesity function.
