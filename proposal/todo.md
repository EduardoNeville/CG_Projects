# Rough steps

1. Create the asteroid
    - (BASE): <br> 
        Displacement Map <br>
        Textures
    - (EXTENSION) <br>
        Making it lose mass as it enters the atmosphere <br>

2. Asteroid particle effects
    - (BASE) <br>
        Fire and smoke <br>
        WebGL Particle Physics

3. Terrain where asteroid lands
    - (BASE) <br>
        Land and water
    - (EXTENSION) <br>
        Clouds <br>
        Impact

4. Physics of entering the atmosphere
    - Equations that make the asteroid enter the atmosphere
